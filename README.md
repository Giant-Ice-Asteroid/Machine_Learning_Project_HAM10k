"Training of neural networks for automated diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions is hampered by the small size and lack of diversity of available dataset of dermatoscopic images. We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset. We collected dermatoscopic images from different populations, acquired and stored by different modalities. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which can serve as a training set for academic machine learning purposes. Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions: Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec), basal cell carcinoma (bcc), benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, bkl), dermatofibroma (df), melanoma (mel), melanocytic nevi (nv) and vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, vasc).

More than 50% of lesions are confirmed through histopathology (histo), the ground truth for the rest of the cases is either follow-up examination (follow_up), expert consensus (consensus), or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy (confocal). The dataset includes lesions with multiple images, which can be tracked by the lesion_id-column within the HAM10000_metadata file.

The test set is not public, but the evaluation server remains running (see the challenge website). Any publications written using the HAM10000 data should be evaluated on the official test set hosted there, so that methods can be fairly compared."

Approach:

Data Exploration & Preprocessing

-Understand the dataset structure
-Preprocess images (resizing, normalization)
-Handle class imbalance
-Split into train/validation/test sets


Model Building

-Create a PyTorch dataset class
-Design a CNN architecture (or use transfer learning)
-Define loss function and optimizer


Training Pipeline

-Implement training loop with validation
-Add logging functionality
-Save model checkpoints


Evaluation & Visualization

-Evaluate on test set
-Visualize predictions and feature maps
-Analyze performance across classes
-Identify potential areas for improvement
